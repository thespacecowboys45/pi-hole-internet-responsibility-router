## A story by The Space Cowboy

Once upno a time, there was a boy.  And his name was St. Nicholas.  He had very cheery red rosy cheeks.  AND by cheeks I'm talking about jowels.  Chunky chunky jowels.  And all that.  And he was a babe, a little newborn baby.

```

And his middle name was: Kiki

```

And he enjoyed cats.  Most of the time, except when they would claw you in the middle of a Fornight game, or something like that.  Anyway, we digress....

### This is the beginning

Of the ending of time, in regards to unregulated internet, and invisible internet, and everything bad internet.

[Bad Internet](https://example.com)

And thus, the internet regulator was borne.

#### Concept

The concept is simple:

Take control of what is piping through your house, whether it be latent contractors doing your wife, or other sorts of malicious type behavior.  Not that any house-contractors would ever consider doing anyone's wife, or anything bad (like steal money) while they are "on the job."

```

Definition: on the job

Doing diligently one tasks until completion and nothing more than that.  And then leaving respectfully.

```

A diachotomy of sorts, where the bad **must exist** because then we will **know** what is good.  Content-wise.  For not everything **is** good content.  We have all wassted aproximately 3 with 100 zeros behind it hours on Tik-Tak, instaham, farcebook, youblowtube, or any sorts of other unregulated content sites.

Am I right?

You are a liar.  You know yourself you are a liar and you know it, and so do not lie to yourself about this fact:  We have all wondered where did Playboy TV get its morals from?  Certainly, we know it was **not** from the Internet.

Right Mr. Gore?  Or do we all forget that back in 1997 when it was a big campaign slogan for your election year.  Marvel.  At the Internet.  Yeah.

Now at least - in this day and age, no one ever rememebers when there was not the internet.

But those days are gone.  In the wind.
